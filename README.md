# Algerian Forest Data Analysis and Predictions

## Project Overview

This project involves an analysis of forest data from Algeria, with predictions generated through machine learning models. The data has been processed and visualized to derive meaningful insights about forest trends, and predictions are made to assist in managing forest resources more effectively. The project includes a Flask-based web application that runs on localhost, allowing users to interact with the data and prediction models through a simple web interface.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: The project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Algerian forest data, uncovering important patterns and trends related to the forest ecosystem.
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: In this model of regression the algorithms used are Linear Regression, lasso, ridge, and for cross validation i have used lassoCV, ridgeCV.
- **Flask Application**: A lightweight Flask app serves as the front end for the project, enabling users to view analysis results and predictions. The app is hosted locally and interacts with the machine learning models and the dataset.
- **Visualization**: The app includes data visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) to provide a clear understanding of the forest data.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```
2. **Use the commande following**:

   ```cmd
   python3 app.py

   ```

3. **Open the Browser by the local host: 5000**
   ```brower
   127.0.0.0.0: 5000/prediction
   ```
